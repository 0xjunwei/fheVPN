ETHGlobal Singapore 2024 Fhenix submission

fheVPN (Proxies) allows users to browse the web anonymously, we offer Proxy as a Service (PaaS). 

Node providers spin up Proxy nodes in different countries and set a price for access to their nodes.

Whitelisting approach thus no password authentication required. Upon payment, your Client IP address is encrypted through Fhenix network in FHE, and only visible to the node provider to whitelist your client IP.

After your IP address has been whitelisted, the client can then view the Server Node IP address and connect, without approval no connections can be made to the IP address.
